## ðŸ”¥Fire SystemðŸ”¥
âœ¨ Measure temperature through the sensor, and filter with a first-degree filter. â€ŽWhen temperature exceeds turn from Fine state to Heat state. And yellow â€ŽLED turn on, send a Warring message through UART, and starts taking â€Žreading from the smoke sensor (Take Read Every 1 sec.)â€Ž

âœ¨ If Smoke increases, fire State Start (turning on the red LED, Siren sound, â€ŽPump, and smoke fan and sending an Alarm message through UART).â€Ž

âœ¨ Sensors read and system states are shown on the LCD screen.â€Ž

âœ¨ The system can be restored only by a password, that can be written â€Žotherwise by Keypad or received from UART if the password writes wrong â€Žfive times user is blocked for will. â€Ž

âœ¨ Password, temp level, and smoke percentage are CFG and can be changed â€Žby the user From CFG Menu and saved in EEPROM.â€Ž

âœ¨ Pump and Smoke fan speed control by reading off the temp sensor and â€Žsmoke sensor respectively.â€Ž

##  ðŸ‘·Implementations:â€Ž
â€Žâœ… Implement MCAL layer (a timer, ADC, DIO, EEPROM, EX interrupt, â€ŽUART â€¦)â€Ž

âœ… Implement HAL layer Drivers (Motor, LCD, Keypad, Sensors,â€¦..)

â€Žâœ… Implement a service layer for timer and UART.â€Ž

â€Žâœ… Service of UART Sends and Receives string and frame through UART â€Žâ€Ž(using Queues and Stacks).â€Ž

â€Žâœ… Implement a Temperature filter for the temp sensor.â€Ž

â€Žâœ… Control Motor Speed by PWM

âœ… Make a user-friendly interface with LCD and Keypad.â€Ž

â€Žâœ… Make a Schedule for Tasks.â€Ž

â€Žâœ… External Interrupt for showing the Cfg menu. â€Ž
